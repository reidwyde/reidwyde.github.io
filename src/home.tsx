                Hi, my name is Reid Wyde. I'm a software developer, data scientist, and published
                researcher, born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

                This website is the home of my professional portfolio. While you're here, why not
                check out my resume, my research, or my free course on machine learning (where we
                cover everything from basic mathematics to advanced forms of deep learning)?

            <h3>About Me</h3>

            <p>
                I started my first job when I was just 12 years old. I was a math tutor. There's
                something so immensely satisfying about watching someone understand something that
                they once thought was confusing. I tutored a variety of subjects all throughout
                middle school, high school and college. I enjoy teaching and I hope you'll find some
                of the resources on this website useful.
            </p>

            <p>If you have any questions, feel free to reach out!</p>
            <br />

            <p>Peace and love,</p>
